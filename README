SON (Simple Object Notation) data interchange format.

Simple data format similar to JSON, but with some minor changes:
    - comments starts with # sign and ends with newline (\n)
    - comma after a key-value pair is optional
    - comma after an array element is optional

JSON is compatible with SON in a sense that
JSON data is also SON data, but not vise versa.

SON data example:

    {
        # Personal information
    
        "name": "Alexander Grothendieck"
        "fields": "mathematics"
        "main_topics": [
            "Etale cohomology"
            "Motives"
            "Topos theory"
            "Schemes"
        ]
    }
